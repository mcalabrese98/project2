## Project Objective:

Identify trends in movie genres, types, and actors that are well-received by audiences, using data from The Movie Database (TMDb). By analyzing key factors such as budget, revenue, ratings, and genre, movie length the project aims to cluster movies into meaningful groups and predict successful investment opportunities using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Goals
- Analyze Trends: Identify patterns in movie genres, budget allocations, and actors that correlate with higher audience reception and revenue.
- Classification Analysis: Utilize clustering techniques to categorize movies into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as genre, budget, and cast. This analysis will help uncover common traits among successful films and provide insights into what factors contribute to a movie's success
- Predictive Modeling: Implement predictive modeling techniques to forecast a movie's success based on historical data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project aims to predict key performance indicators such as box office revenue, audience ratings, and critical acclaim. This will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about future movie investments and production strategies
