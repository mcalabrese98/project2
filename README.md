## Project Objective:

Identify trends in movie genres, types, and actors that are well-received by audiences, using data from The Movie Database (TMDb) and IMDb reviews. By analyzing key factors such as budget, revenue, ratings, and genre, the project aims to cluster movies into meaningful groups and predict successful investment opportunities using machine learning algorithms.

Data Collection:
Source: Use TMDb, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes to gather movie metadata and reviews. These sites provide information on movie titles, release dates, genres, directors, actors, ratings, and audience reviews.
